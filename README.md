In this repository, you can find the weekly milestones:

1. **Milestone 1: Prototypes to integrate orbits without functions.**

   This milestone introduces the concepts of numerical integration and how to implement them in Python.

2. **Milestone 2: Prototypes to integrate orbits with functions.**

   This milestone expands on the previous milestone by introducing the concept of integrating orbits with functions.

3. **Milestone 3: Error estimation of numerical solutions.**

   This milestone discusses the concept of error estimation in numerical solutions and how to implement it in Python.

4. **Milestone 4: Linear problems. Regions of absolute stability.**

   This milestone introduces the concept of linear problems and their regions of absolute stability.

5. **Milestone 5: N-body problem.**

   This milestone discusses the N-body problem and how to solve it using numerical methods.

6. **Milestone 6: Lagrange points and their stability.**

   This milestone introduces the concept of Lagrange points and their stability.

7. **Milestone 7: Arenstorf's periodic orbit.**

   This milestone discusses Arenstorf's periodic orbit and how to simulate it using numerical methods.
