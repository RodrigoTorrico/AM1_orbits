In this repository, you can find the weekly milestones:
**Milestone 1**: Prototypes to integrate orbits without functions.
**Milestone 2**: Prototypes to integrate orbits with functions.
  - **Milestone 3**: Error estimation of numerical solutions.
  - **Milestone 4**: Linear problems. Regions of absolute stability.
  - **Milestone 5**: N-body problem.
  - **Milestone 6**: Lagrange points and their stability.
  - **Milestone 7**: Arenstorf's periodic orbit.
